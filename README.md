# Welcome to My Portfolio!
##### My name is Spencer Thompson and I am a Senior at Baylor University majoring in Marketing and Business Analytics. I am currently planning on pursuing a Master's degree in Business Analytics or Data Science at TBD University. As you can see, sports is one of my biggest passions and the source for the majority of my projects. I have experience using a variety of methodologies from clustering to binary classifications to predictive modeling. My primary focus is in the field of player evaluation and player valuation.
