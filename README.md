# Welcome to My Portfolio!
##### My name is Spencer Thompson and I am a Senior at Baylor University majoring in Marketing and Business Analytics. I am currently planning on pursuing a Master's degree in Business Analytics or Data Science at TBD University. As a lifelong fan and athlete, sports is one of my biggest passions and the source for the majority of my projects. I have experience using a variety of methodologies from clustering to binary classifications to predictive modeling. My primary focus is in the field of player evaluation and player valuation. Below is a list my current and past projects along with a brief overview. Thank you for checking me out!

## My Projects 
### [Predicting Stunts on NFL Pass Plays](https://github.com/spencermt000/portfolio/blob/main/_posts/NFL_stunts.md)
**Overview**: Using player tracking

### [Clustering NBA Player's Defensive Performance](https://github.com/spencermt000/portfolio/blob/main/_posts/NBA_def_pca.md)
**Overview**: Using

### [Analyzing Chess Games](https://github.com/spencermt000/portfolio/blob/main/_posts/chess_myself.md)
**Overview**: I downloaded the .pgn files of over 2000 of my chess games and nearly 30,000 games from Grandmaster Hikaru Nakimura. I wrote code in Python to loop through each game in the files, tracking each pieces' location, and calculating the "scope" of the piece. I used R to further clean and organize the data before using Tableau for the visualizations. Scope refers to how many squares a piece can see, excluding pawns. I also kept additional data like the ECO code for the opening played, the unique piece ID (since there's 2 bishops, knights, rooks), the winner of the game, and the ELO of the players. I wanted to see if there is any interesting trends regarding piece activity throughout the game and how openings might affect that.

### [Calculating WAR in NFL using RAPM and Hierarchical Bayesian Models](https://github.com/spencermt000/portfolio/blob/main/_posts/NFL_war.md) (in progress) 
**Overview**: Using

### Scraping Fantasy Football League & Draft Data using SleeperAPI (planned)
